            Bettina has always loved aprons. Growing up in Germany, she would spend hours in the kitchen with her Mom cooking and Dad baking. Always wearing her Sch√ºrze (apron). When an apron got lost in the mail from Germany to the United States she wasn't able to find one that looked and felt like ones from her childhood home in the Black Forest. She started to make aprons as gifts for family and friends at first and when the feedback came back positive Schurzenliebe (apron love) was born.
